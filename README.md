# Playlist Viewer


This is a website that displays a list of songs that Squibs has in their media library, you can use this to generate a request for a song to play, based on what is in the playlist. 

This is intended to be used for Squibs' twitch streams, using a channel points redemption.

This project is currently in development, and may not be working as intended.
